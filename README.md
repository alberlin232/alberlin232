As a passionate and innovative software engineer, I developed a novel concurrent skiplist in C/C++ that leverages machine learning techniques, achieving a 2x speedup compared to industry-standard lists. With a Master's and Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Lehigh University, I specialize in multithreaded programming, distributed systems, and advanced data structures. My technical skills include C/C++, Python, Rust, Linux, SQL, and Java..
