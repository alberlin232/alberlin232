I am a student at Lehigh University studying Computer Science and Data Science in the P.C Rossen School of Engineering. 
Currently, I work as a Research Assistant for Professor [Thomas McAndrew](http://www.thomasmcandrew.com) and build statistical models to forecast COVID-19 and other infectious disease agents to support public health decision making. I am also working on creating a rigorous test bed for ensemble models of influenza-like illnesses in order to compare the performance of two or more different ensemble algorithms on the same surveillance data and on the same set of individual models.
